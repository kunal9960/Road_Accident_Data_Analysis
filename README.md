# Road Accident Data Analysis

Welcome to the Road Accident Data Analysis project! This repository contains an Excel spreadsheet designed to analyze various aspects of road accidents, providing insights into accident trends, contributing factors, and potential interventions. This README will guide you through the contents and features of the spreadsheet.

## Features
- **Accident Dashboard**: An interactive dashboard providing insights into accident trends, including total accidents, severity levels, accident hotspots, and trends over time.
  
- **Location Analysis**: Analyze accident data by location to identify high-risk areas, contributing factors, and potential interventions to improve road safety.
  
- **Vehicle Analysis**: Gain insights into vehicle-related factors contributing to accidents, such as vehicle type, speed, and conditions, to inform safety measures and regulations.
  
- **Driver Analysis**: Analyze driver-related factors contributing to accidents, such as age, gender, and behavior, to develop targeted interventions and educational campaigns.

- **Data Cleaning**: Prepare the dataset for analysis by cleaning and organizing the data. This includes removing duplicates, correcting errors, and standardizing formats to ensure data accuracy and consistency.
  
- **Data Visualization**: Utilizes pivot tables and charts to summarize and visualize key metrics and trends for easy interpretation and decision-making.
